# Misassumptions
_bad ideas I used to take for granted_

This little book is a growing collection of assumptions that I (as a product of my biology, my culture and my personal biases) used to live by. One by one I discovered (sometimes painfully) that the ideas I thought I was supposed to live by were either simply false, unproductive or unnecessary for me. Sometimes I consciously opted for alternative assumptions. Other times I learned to live without any. But most importantly I realized that these were mere assumptions, ideas, concepts and not the hard boundaries of the universe I was put into. This feeling of breaking free of a certain misassumption is (for me) one of life's great joys.

Beyond the pleasure of sharing these joys with the world, I'm writing these thoughts down here with three more practical objectives in mind:

1. I know that I need to be reminded of these discoveries quite often. Misassumptions have an annoying habit of sneaking back into the background of my awareness even when I think I've shaken them off completely. And what better way to keep oneself in check than to write this stuff down and make it public?

2. I hope that people I love may find some of these thoughts useful and maybe reading this will even spare them some of the pain that very often accompanies a personal discovery of a misassumption - because when life bangs you against the wall of an imaginary box you've been living in for your whole life, the pain is very real.

3. I realize that most likely in the process of my current discoveries I will not only tear down old imaginary walls, but will aslo unintentionally build up new ones. Documenting the train of thought will possibly help me later see the new walls more clearly and tear them down in turn. Or consciously choose to keep them.

Last but not least, I have to mention that the cathy subtitle of this book ("bad ideas I used to live by") is in itself pregnant with an awful misassumption that needs to be cleared. It's obvious to me that there is no such thing as a bad idea, or a bad assumption or concept. Philosophically speaking, I'm very much a pragmatist. A concept can't be good or bad, it can be productive or counterproductive to somebody in a certain context. The ideas I mention in this collection are (as I have discovered) counterproductive for me in my current frame of
reference. All I can do is document this discovery, explain why I consider them counterproductive and, sometimes, offer alternative concepts. All of this is personal and should be treated as such. What works for me, is unlikely to work for you. Or even for me some years later. But one thing I do believe strongly is that having an alternative concept can't really hurt.
This last assumption (like all the others) we will have to test together.
Here we go.

### Misassumptions:

* I should always try to say exactly what I think
* What other people say is actually what they mean
* Work is something you get paid for
* Time that I put in matters
* If I do something great I will know it
* Objective reality is real, what I feel is distorted
* Pain is absolute
* Intentional action is wise, random action is stupid
* Talent is about ability to do something better than others
* Love is about finding the right person and then staying in love "till death do us part"
